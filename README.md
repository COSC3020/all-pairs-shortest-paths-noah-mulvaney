# All Pairs Shortest Paths

In the lectures, we've seen Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths
from a given vertex to all other vertices in the graph. We've also covered the
Floyd-Warshall algorithm for finding the shortest path between all *pairs* of
vertices. It works as follows:

Given a graph $G = (V, E)$ with weighted edges:
- initialize a $|V|\times|V|$ matrix `dist` to $\infty$
- for each vertex $v \in V$, `dist[v][v] = 0`
- for each edge $(u,v) = e \in E$, `dist[u][v] = weight((u,v))`
- for each vertex $k\in V$:
    - for each vertex $i\in V$:
        - for each vertex $j\in V$:
            - `if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]:`
              `dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]`

Implement this algorithm, starting with the template I provided in `code.js`.
The function takes a weighted graph graph and returns the matrix with the
distances, as described above. You can choose any data structures you like for
the implementation.

I have not provided any test code, but you can base yours on test code from
other exercises. Your tests must check the correctness of the result of running
the function and run automatically when you commit through a GitHub action.

## Runtime Analysis

My implementation has a complexity of $\Theta(|V|^3)$, using an adjacency matrix with 0 representing no edge. I used 2 loops through the nodes to initalize the distance matrix. I used another loop to set the distance from each node to itself to 0. I used 2 nested loops over the nodes to set the distances equal to the weights. Three nested loops over $V$ are used to find the minimum distance for each pair. This nesting leads to the leading term of $|V|^3$.
